mv empty_local_settings.py local_settings.py

open a Python Interpreter and run:

from random import choice
''.join([choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])

paste the output_of_that_command as the 

SECRET_KEY = ....

in your local_settings.py

then you can run syncdb and have an sqlite DB
runserver will serve your static files while LIVE=False

set LIVE=True to try out your local_settings for production MEDIA and DB adapter

Also, to remove the boiler-plate revision control and start your own simply:

sudo rm -r .git/ 

from the projects root dir
and git init, hg init or what have you...
