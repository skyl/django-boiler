Django-Boiler
=============

A ridiculous app that just speeds my initial build up to development by
quite some amount of time really.  Does all of the adjustments to settings
that I like and makes the project conveniently shareable with local_settings.py
and a premade .gitignore.  All of those little things that I have to do before
I start shifting from development to production but I just want the admin
media served correctly without remembering what exactly I need to do.  Has a
views.py with a bunch of imports so I don't have to remember or look up where
all of the stuff that I need is.

There is a PROJECT_DIR setting, a LIVE setting and everything is mobile and
safely shareable from the beginning.  See DOC for how to use.

Oh yeah, and there is a wsgi file for deployment and a good fluid boiler layout
and css to make it really easy.

Thanks to http://designinfluences.com/. For the liquid grid layout.

Thanks to everyone who works on jQuery and Django.

There is a lot of static media that you can take or leave.  A home url is
already plugged directly into templates/base.html.
