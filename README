Django-Boiler
=============

A ridiculous app that just speeds my initial build up to development by
quite some amount of time really.  Does all of the adjustments to settings
that I like and makes the project conveniently shareable with local_settings.py
and a premade .gitignore.  All of those little things that I have to do before
I start shifting from development to production but I just want the admin
media served correctly without remembering what exactly I need to do.  Has a
views.py with a bunch of imports so I don't have to remember or look up where
all of the stuff that I need is.
